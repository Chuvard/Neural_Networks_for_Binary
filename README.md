# Neural_Networks_for_Binary

### Project's Title: Neural_Networks_for_Binary


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
- In this exercise, we will use a neural network to recognize two handwritten digits: zero and one. This is a binary classification task. Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. We will extend this network to recognize all 10 digits (0-9) in a future assignment.

- This exercise will show how the methods can be used for this classification task.

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Neural_Networks_for_Binary" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Sections "Importing modules" and "Dataset".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Dataset" Section for getting previously mentioned project goals due to Neural Network Machine Learning model execution (for binary classification).

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
